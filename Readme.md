# the2win Backend
## ORM and Database

This service uses Sequelize (MySQL) models for Users, Transactions, Crash/Wingo rounds and bets. On startup, the server will:

- Ensure the target database exists (CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS)
- Register models and auto-sync the schema

Control with env vars:

- `DB_SYNC=true` to force sync in any environment (defaults true in non-production)
- `DB_SYNC_ALTER=true` to allow ALTER-based schema updates (defaults true in non-production)

Environment DB vars:

- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`


Initial backend scaffold with MySQL schema and migration system.

## Quick Start

1. Copy environment file
```
copy backend/.env.example backend/.env
```
2. Edit `backend/.env` with your database credentials.
3. Install dependencies
```
cd backend
npm install
```
4. Run migrations (SQL files in `src/migrations` are applied automatically)
```
npm run migrate
```
5. Admin auto-creation

On startup the server will ensure an admin account exists using these env vars (with safe defaults for local dev):

- `ADMIN_EMAIL` (default: admin@the2win.local)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (default: ChangeThisAdminPass123!)
- `ADMIN_FORCE_RESET` (optional, default: false) â€” if true, updates existing admin's password and role

You can still run the legacy seeder:
```
npm run seed:admin
```
6. Start dev server
```
npm run dev
```
